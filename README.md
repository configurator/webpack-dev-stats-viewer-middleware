# webpack-dev-stats-viewer-middleware
Stats viewer for webpack-dev-middleware

## Usage

This works in conjuction with (webpack-dev-middleware)[https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware] to enable viewing the raw stats generated by the server.

The statsViewer sets itself up, by accepting the following parameters:

* `expressApp` - the app created by `express()`
* `url` - the url to respond to (this must be a url under the webpack middleware's path)

The url must be under the webpack path, because webpack adds the stats object before passing the request on. For that to work, `webpack-dev-middleware` must receive a parameter, `serverSideRender: true`.

## Example

    // External requirements
    const express = require('express');
    const webpack = require('webpack');
    const webpackMiddleware = require('webpack-dev-middleware');
    const statsViewer = require('webpack-dev-stats-viewer-middleware');

    // Setup
    const expressApp = express();

    // Client-side applications
    const app = require('../app-definition');

    // Webpack Dev Middleware
    expressApp.use('/dev-server/', webpackMiddleware(webpack(app), {
        serverSideRender: true
    });
    // Stats viewer
    statsViewer(expressApp, '/dev-server/stats');

    // HTTPS Setup
    expressApp.listen(8080);
